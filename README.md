## Affiliation

I am currently a senior researcher (W2) at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics 
in Garching bei München (Germany), within the department of Numerical Methods in Plasma Physics. 
I am also lecturer (Privatdozent) at the Technical University of Munich.

## Research interests

My current research is on mathematical problems related to plasma physics. 
It includes structure-preserving conforming and nonconforming Finite Elements,
Hamiltonian models for Maxwell-Vlasov and MHD systems,
and hybrid particle/semi-lagrangian methods for transport equations.
